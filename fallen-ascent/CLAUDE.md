## Project overview

Fallen Ascent is a 2D colony sim set inside a vast, BLAME!-inspired megastructure.
Players manage a settlement of sentient robots in a post-post-apocalyptic world.
Built with Godot 4.4 (Forward+ renderer), GDScript, targeting PC only. All art
in the prototype is **placeholder** — flat-colored tiles drawn via a `TileSet`
of solid-color textures, swapped out for real pixel art later.

Design influences: Kenshi, RimWorld, Dwarf Fortress, Cataclysm: DDA and factorio.
Far-future stretch: a Kenshi-style RPG mode controlling a single entity.

**Optimization is priority #1.** Every system is chosen with later scaling in
mind. When in doubt, prefer the cheaper approach now and measure before
"improving."

**Placeholder atlas rule.** Whenever a new item, resource, static object, or
tile is added, also add a flat-color placeholder entry for it:
- Single-tile terrain goes in `resources/tiles/placeholder_atlas.png`.
- Multi-tile structures or object references go in
  `resources/tiles/placeholder_atlas_multi_tile.png`.
- Static world props that are not terrain, items, UI icons, or entities go in
  `resources/objects/placeholder_static_objects_atlas.png`.
- Loose items and materials go in `resources/items/placeholder_items_atlas.png`.
- UI command icons go in `resources/ui/placeholder_ui_atlas.png`.
- If terrain atlas cells change, update `resources/tiles/placeholder_tiles.tres`
  so the new tile id has a TileSet atlas entry. Keep cells 16x16 aligned.
- Treat placeholder atlases as append-only. Add new cells by expanding the
  canvas or filling unused aligned cells; do not reshuffle or repaint existing
  cells unless every coordinate reference is updated in the same change.

UPDATE THIS FILE WHENEVER NEEDED.

```

Naming convention for script roles:
- `*Generator` — pure (or near-pure) producer of data, no scene-tree lifecycle.
- `*Manager`   — owns the lifecycle of a collection of nodes/resources.
- `*Controller`— translates input/state into behavior on a single node.
- `*Data`      — `Resource` subclass holding typed, savable state.

## Designation tabs

The colony palette is grouped into four tabs (`ColonyHud._set_tab`):

- **Orders** — task overlays (mine).
- **Zones** — stockpile paint/remove.
- **Rooms** — Rimworld-style room designations (currently Dock Room).
- **Structures** — buildables.

There is no per-tab Cancel button: a left-click on any world tile while a
designation mode is active cancels it (see `SelectionController._unhandled_input`),
and Esc still cancels through `Designator.cancel_active()`.

## Bot mood + needs

`Worker._mood` is a 0..100 stat with `MOOD_BASELINE = 80`. `_unsatisfied_needs`
is recomputed every frame from `RoomManager`. Each unmet need drains mood at
`MOOD_NEED_DECAY_PER_SEC`; when satisfied, mood drifts back to baseline at
`MOOD_RECOVERY_PER_SEC`. Add new needs by appending to `_unsatisfied_needs`
in `Worker._update_mood` — the HUD will render them automatically.

`RoomManager` owns the list of player-designated rooms. v1 has one kind,
`DOCK_ROOM`: a 1×2+ painted area containing at least one Dock (or
Maintenance Dock) structure. Rooms can be assigned to a single worker via
`ensure_dock_room_for`; once assigned, the worker's "Needs dock room" need
is satisfied.

## Coding standards

- **GDScript, always static-typed.** `func foo(x: int) -> Vector2i:`. The only
  untyped `var` allowed is a one-off local where the type is obvious from the
  RHS.
- **Naming.** `snake_case` for files / vars / functions, `PascalCase` for
  classes / scenes / Resources, `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- **`class_name` sparingly.** Add it only when a script is referenced by other
  scripts as a type. Otherwise omit, to keep the global namespace clean.
- **`@export` / `@onready`.** `@export` for any value a designer should tweak
  in the inspector. `@onready` for child-node refs. Never `get_node()` inside
  `_process` / `_physics_process`.
- **Signals before refs.** Cross-system communication goes through `EventBus`.
  Intra-scene communication uses local signals between sibling nodes.
- **No business logic in per-frame callbacks** unless it actually needs
  per-frame work. Prefer `Timer`, signals, or `await`. If you must use
  `_process`, gate the heavy bits behind a "dirty" flag or visibility check.
- **`Vector2i` for grid coords, `Vector2` for pixel-space.** Mixing them is the
  #1 source of off-by-one bugs in procgen.

---

## Autoloads (keep this list short)

Current autoloads, in load order:

1. **`EventBus`** (`scripts/autoload/EventBus.gd`) — declares every
   cross-system signal in one place. No state, no logic. Read the header
   comment of `EventBus.gd` for the signal catalogue.
2. **`GameState`** (`scripts/autoload/GameState.gd`) — holds the global
   ambient state that almost every system needs:
   - `world_seed: int`
   - `selected_site: SiteData`
   - `game_speed: float`  (0.0 = paused; speed is applied via
     `Engine.time_scale` so all sim systems pick it up for free)

   Setters emit the matching `EventBus` signal — never write directly to
   these fields from outside, always go through the setter.

**Bar for adding a new autoload:** it must be needed by ≥3 unrelated scenes
*and* it must not fit comfortably inside `GameState`. Otherwise, instance it
where it's used. Save system / pathfinding / AI director will probably each
warrant their own — when they're built, not before.

---

## Optimization guidelines

- **Tiles render through `TileMapLayer`**, never per-tile `Sprite2D`. The
  batched draw path is the only one that scales to the megastructure sizes we
  want.
- **Colony world is chunked** (32×32 tiles, `Chunk.SIZE` is the source of
  truth). `ChunkManager` only keeps chunks within `view_radius` of the camera
  in the scene tree; others are freed.
- **Procgen is deterministic from a seed.** Never serialize generated tiles
  until they've been modified by gameplay — regenerate from `(world_seed,
  chunk_coord)` on demand. Saves should store *diffs*, not raw chunks.
- **Avoid per-frame allocations.** Reuse `Vector2i` arrays, `PackedInt32Array`,
  etc. across calls when possible.
- **Object pooling** for any entity that will exist in >100 instances (robots,
  items, projectiles). Not needed yet, but reserve `scripts/pool/` for it when
  it is.
- **Profile before optimizing.** Godot's built-in profiler +
  `Performance.get_monitor()` for FPS / draw calls / objects. Never optimize
  blind.

## Adding new features without breaking things

- **New cross-system signal?** Declare it on `EventBus`, with a one-line
  comment describing the payload contract. Update the catalogue at the top of
  `EventBus.gd`.
- **New autoload?** Justify it against the bar in the autoloads section. If
  it's borderline, instance it locally first.
- **New scene?** Drop it under the matching `scenes/<domain>/` and put its
  script under the parallel `scripts/<domain>/` path. Don't co-locate scripts
  with scenes — easier to grep, and avoids `.import`-noise in the scripts dir.
- **Touching procgen?** Bump `WorldGenerator.WORLDGEN_VERSION` so old saves are
  detectable. Determinism tests (when we have them) live next to the generator.
- **Touching `GameState` or `EventBus`?** Treat it like a public API change —
  expect every system to be affected. Search for usages first.

## Godot-specific gotchas

- **Don't use `@tool`** unless the script must run in-editor. It doubles your
  debugging surface (in-editor crashes are worse than runtime ones).
- **`_process(delta)` runs every frame for every node in the tree**, even when
  off-screen. Gate heavy work with `visible`, chunk-activity flags, or just
  don't add `_process` at all.
- **`queue_free()` is deferred** until end-of-frame. Don't read refs to a
  queue-freed node in the same frame; use `is_instance_valid()` if unsure.
- **Prefer `Resource` subclasses over `Dictionary`** for typed game data
  (`SiteData`, future `RobotStats`, etc.). You get autocompletion, type
  checking, and free disk serialization.
- **`randi()` is global and not seeded by default.** Use a local
  `RandomNumberGenerator` with an explicit `seed` for anything that must be
  reproducible. Mix seeds via `hash([world_seed, chunk_coord.x, chunk_coord.y])`.
- **`change_scene_to_file` runs deferred.** Anything you set on `GameState`
  *before* the call will be visible to the new scene's `_ready`.
